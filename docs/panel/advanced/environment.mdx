# Environment Configuration
Panel settings are stored in environment variables. In standard installations, you do not need to manually set any environment variables; they will be set by artisan, the web installer, and the settings menu. For automated installations, it may be useful to set the environment variables directly rather than through a menu.

## Configured by Artisan
By default, these environment variables are set when you run `php artisan p:environment:setup` and saved to your .env file. Environment variables that are not required for operation and that can be configured using the installer or settings menus are excluded from this list.

- `APP_ENV`: Set to `production` for production deployments. `[production, local, testing]` Default: production
- `APP_DEBUG`: 
- `APP_KEY`: A base64-encoded randomly-generated string used as an encryption key.
- `APP_TIMEZONE`: The timezone for your panel. See https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php for a list of options. Default: `UTC`
- `APP_LOCALE`: Does nothing, as locale is set per-user. May be removed or changed to set the default locale in a future version. Default: `en`


## Configured By Installer
By default, these environment variables are all set by the installer and saved to your .env file.

- `APP_INSTALLED`: If you are manually configuring the panel via environment variables, set it to `true` to disable the installer.
- `APP_NAME`: This will be the Name of your Panel. Default: `Pelican`
- `APP_URL`: This will be the URL you access your Panel from, including https:// or http://. Can be set to 'http://localhost' on port 80 only.
- `DB_CONNECTION`: The type of database to use for the panel. `[sqlite, mariadb, mysql]`
- `CACHE_STORE`: The driver used for caching. We recommend "Filesystem." `[file, redis]`
- `SESSION_DRIVER`: The driver used for storing sessions. We recommend "Filesystem" or "Database." `[file, database, cookie, redis]`
- `QUEUE_CONNECTION`: The driver used for handling queues. We recommend "Database." `[database, redis, sync]`

:::warning
    If you are using `redis` for your `SESSION_DRIVER` or `QUEUE_CONNECTION`, you must set `CACHE_STORE` to `redis`.
