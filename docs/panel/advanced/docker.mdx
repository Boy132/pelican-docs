# Panel in Docker

## Volumes

## Environment Variables
These environment variables are required before using the installer.

- `APP_URL`: This will be the URL you access your Panel from, including https:// or http://. Can be set to 'http://localhost' on port 80 only.
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Used by Caddy for generating SSL certificates.
- `APP_DEBUG`: Set to `false` for production deployments. `[true, false]`
- `APP_ENV`: Set to `production` for production deployments. `[production, local, testing]`

### Configured By Installer
By default, these environment variables are all set by the installer and saved to a .env file which is persisted in `/pelican-data/`. You can use this information to configure them when creating the container instead.

- `APP_INSTALLED`: If you are manually configuring the panel via environment variables, set it to `true` to disable the installer.
- `APP_KEY`: A 32-character-long randomly-generated string used as an encryption key.
- `APP_TIMEZONE`: The timezone for your panel. See https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php for a list of options.
- `APP_NAME`: This will be the Name of your Panel. Default: Pelican
- `DB_CONNECTION`: The type of database to use for the panel. `[sqlite, mariadb, mysql]`
- `CACHE_STORE`: The driver used for caching. We recommend "Filesystem." `[file, redis]`
- `SESSION_DRIVER`: The driver used for storing sessions. We recommend "Filesystem" or "Database." `[file, database, cookie, redis]`
- `QUEUE_CONNECTION`: The driver used for handling queues. We recommend "Database." `[database, redis, sync]`

:::warning
    If you are using `redis` for your `SESSION_DRIVER` or `QUEUE_CONNECTION`, you must set `CACHE_STORE` to `redis`.
