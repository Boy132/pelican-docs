## Install Redis

To install Redis you first need add their repository.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list
```

Now you can install Redis by simply running the following commands.

```sh
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y redis-server
```

Also make sure to enable that redis will start on boot. You can do that by running the following command:

```sh

```
