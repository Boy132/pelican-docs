# Getting Started

Pelican Panel is designed to run on your webserver.

You are expected to read through our documentation.
We have spent a lot of time curating these docs for the community,
so please take some time to read through them before asking for help on the forums!

<Admonition type="danger">
    **You should have some basic familiarity with Linux before you proceed!**
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
    Pelican is currently in **Beta**! Some things might change / break between beta versions!
</Admonition>

### Picking an Operating System (OS)

Pelican runs on a wide range of operating systems, so pick whichever you are most comfortable using. Note: Other OS's, not listed below, might still work.

<Admonition type="warning">
    OpenVZ, **unless specifically configured**, will **not** work with Pelican.

| Operating System | Version | Supported | Notes                                                                 |

SQLite support depends on [libsqlite3-0_3.35+](https://pkgs.org/download/libsqlite3-0) being on the host system.
Ubuntu 20.04 & Debian 11 do not meet this requirement.

### Dependencies
<Admonition type="warning">
    The `ondrej/php` repository is required to install the latest versions of PHP and its required extensions.

    It can be added with the following command.
    ```sh
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
    ```
</Admonition>

* PHP `8.3` (recommended) or `8.2` with the following extensions: `gd`, `mysql`, `mbstring`, `bcmath`, `xml`, `curl`, `zip`, `intl`, `sqlite3` and `fpm`
* MySQL `8` (`mysql-server`) **or** MariaDB `10.3`+
* A webserver (Apache, NGINX, Caddy, etc.)
* `curl`
* `tar`
* `composer` v2

### Create Directories & Downloading Files

The first step in this process is to create the folder where the panel will live and then move ourselves into that
newly created folder.

```sh
mkdir -p /var/www/pelican
cd /var/www/pelican
```

Once you have created a new directory to use and moved into it you'll need to download the Panel files. This
is as simple as using `curl` to download the latest release.
```sh
curl -L https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzv
```

### Install Composer

Next we will set up Composer along with the required dependencies.

``` bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

```sh
sudo composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

### Setting Permissions

The next stop in the installation process is to set the correct permissions on the Panel files so that the webserver can
use them correctly.

```sh
chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```

<Tabs groupId="webserver">
    <TabItem value='NGINX/Apache'>
        ```sh
        chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pelican/*
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux NGINX'>
        ```sh
        chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/pelican/*
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux Apache'>
        ```sh
        chown -R apache:apache /var/www/pelican/*
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
