    <TabItem label="Licensing" value="licensing">
        The Pelican Panel has been relicensed to **AGPLv3**. Wings still uses **MIT**.

        This license change does only affect you if you meet _all_ of the following requirements:
        1. You modified the Pelican panel source files.
        2. These modifications are not open source.
        3. Your modified panel is publicly available. (Note: People who are family, friends, and acquaintances are not the public)

        If you meet _all_ of the above requirements you need a commercial license.
        Please note that the usage or development of plugins/ themes does not require a commercial license.

        You can find more detailed information about the new license in [this blog post](https://pelican.dev/blog/relicensing-pelican-to-agpl).

            We can't say that. That's up to the Maintainer of Pterodactyl. Pelican and Pterodactyl are separate projects.
